# 2012_Election_Poll_Analysis
Data visualization over 2012 US election polls. This includes the factors that helped each candidate to gain votes.

We have also analyzed on another datset which contains informations about donations from various contributors and their corresponding city and other features. This helped us analyze which candidate had more donations and helped us understand the economy class of people that believed in election candidates. 

The first dataset helped us understand the criteria by which each candidate won the poll. I have tried to understand the sentiments of the voters to that lead them in choosing between the candidates.
